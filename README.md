# Software-Engineering-CSU33012
First two assignments (LCA) were initially submitted in other repositories, but the source code will be moved into this repository.
If want to see a commit history check the repos ProjectsInVisualStudioCode (For LCA python Version) and JavaProjects (For LCA Java version, this is the version that can handle DAGs).

The final Two assignments:
Initially attempted to do this assignment in Haskell (see Aceess-GitHub-API-MH in ProjectsInVisualStudioCode repo) but abandoned this approach, as although I was able to get the followers of a user and output this JSON it was taking too much time to get more useful data and I decided to instead do these two assignments in RStudio (all commit history will be present in this repo and project is called SENG Interrogate GitHub API) as I am far more familar with R and can take in the data and create nice plots all in the one environement/program.

Please find an example of one of the graphs generated, using the plot_ly library in R which makes use of D3.js library, by my R program in png or html format. The html format should be interactive, but PNG format is just a picture. They are both named RepoSize vs CreationDate and the data is of the user 'phadej'.
